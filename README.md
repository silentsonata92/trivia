# Code Trivia
## Description
- Motiviation: To practice what I have learned
- Built this project with the intention to improve myself and to learn more 
- During this project, the hardest part was utilzing all the information I learned. The biggest problems were related to how much material we had learned and had to put into practice in such a short time for such a big assignment.
- I learned that utilizing outside resources and allowing yourself to understand the material better through the use of google or stackoverflow supplements what I've learned in class.

## Features
The features of the Trivia page will have the following:
- A front page display with a button to start the quiz
- The start button and the timer start
- One question appear after another after an answer has been selected
- After all the questions have been answered: the end page
    The end page reveals the score with extra quotes and also an option to submit the score.
    There are two buttons, one for submitting the score where the score and the initial will be stored into local data but also to show on the current page a display of stored data. The other button is simply a button to refresh the page to allow an user to play again.
## Roadmap
- Will be working on this homework to better improve the css and add more features.
- Will be adding more questions
- Maybe might try to replicate Jeopardy
